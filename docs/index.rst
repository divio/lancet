Introduction
============

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalpel:

   A scalpel, or lancet, is a small and extremely sharp bladed instrument used
   for surgery, anatomical dissection, and various arts and crafts (called a
   hobby knife).

Lancet is a command line utility to streamline the various activities related
to the development and maintenance of a software package.
