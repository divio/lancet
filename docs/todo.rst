TODO
====

A lot of commands are still missing, as for example:

* ``review``: to streamline the whole reviewing process (pulling, linting,\
  diffs,...).
* ``merge``: to help in getting a more strict merge process in place (and
  cleanup afterwards). Can include rebasing helpers.
* Other issue tracker/Harvest interaction utilities (``list``, ``search``,
  ``comment``, ...)

* Harvest: https://id.getharvest.com/developers (user_id: number in the profile url, username: account id on developers)
* JIRA: https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens (username: your divio.ch email address)
* Gitlab: https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens (api)
